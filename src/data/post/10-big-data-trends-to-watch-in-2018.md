The future of Big Data will be dominated by the open source applications like Spark, Apache Hadoop, and others. Forrester Research claims that this tendency is increasing 32.9 percent per year.

**The Internet of Things (IoT)**

The Internet of Things (IoT) allows an access to data from various devices. Unsurprisingly, this year promises is to become a revolution in the interconnectedness of smart home technology. With the majority of people in the developed world routinely operating multiple devices, loT attempts to fill the void between data collection and enable communication between different sources.

**Cloud Computing**

Businesses across the globe have started to use cloud computing for their IT activities. Primarily, many companies are using cloud to run the apps. Predictions shows that this percentage of companies relying on cloud computing will only continue to increase over the next few years. Big data Analytics is another important predicted trend in the IT world that influences not only how the cloud is used, but also addressing the growing demand and providing opportunities for innovation.

**Machine Learning & AI**

These technologies are on the spotline, and more companies have begun investing in it. Machine learning as a branch of AI, analyze big data without being explicitly programmed.

**Chatbots**

The arrival of messaging apps furthered the development of chatbots. Chatbot is a software program that conducts a communication with a user via textual methods. With a help of chatbots, you can carry out a number of different tasks, such as chatting with users, helping with purchases or pushing social media activities as much as like the famous app or also known as Crowdfire.

**Predictive Analytics**

Big data helps businesses to get the predictions of future behavior. In few words, predictable analysis brings the opportunity to customers ‘to know their customers’, and consequently maximize the profit and choose the right marketing strategy.

**Cybersecurity  
**

The last and arguably the most important field where changes must occur is cybersecurity. Today we live in two worlds, with the second being played out or inside of our computers. As our lives continue to advance and become digital, the demands for cybersecurity and policing of the Internet will continue to expand.

As cybersecurity adapts and develops to meet its society’s needs, its demand, function, and role will be forced to evolve due it its security. Anti-piracy companies will help by blocking illegal content, and new technologies will protect our data and computers from attacks, and other kinds of damage.

**Business Intelligence**

The companies’ decision-making will be based on big data. Even if it’s a small company, ignoring the importance of data science will lead to regressive management and loss of the profit. The use of Business Intelligence from Cloud will drastically increase. All decisions regarding market growth or expansion into new regions, or markets will be based on Big Data.

**Big data focussed Intelligent Apps**

Such application incorporates Big data Analytics to provide personalization and improved service. AI and Machine learning will be implemented in almost every app.

**General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**

The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has already taken an effect; this has got many organizations and companies to ensure they comply with such regulation.

When question were asked about the function of Big Data in their respective organizations, about 66 percent of the respondents stated that they took cognizance of it to be either “strategic” or “game-changing”. Only 17 percent stated that big data was nonetheless “experimental” at their companies, and some 17 percent described their efforts as “tactical.”

These various perspectives on big data make it clear that this is one trend that is not going to fade away anytime quickly.

Predictions were given about the future of big data and what companies would face if they see big data as a strategy. Our company, MicroMoney, uses Big Data to provide our customers with the best service, and banks with the most accurate information to serve customers they couldn’t serve before.

Big Data and analytics will drive modern business operations, and will not certainly reflect their overall performance; corporations will take an encompassing approach to facts and analytics.

Organizations will create end-to-end architectures that will allow data management and analytics from the center to the edge of the organization; and company executives will make Big Data and analytics as part of their enterprises’ strategy, which shall permit big data professionals to take up new roles and create business growth for corporate excellence.
