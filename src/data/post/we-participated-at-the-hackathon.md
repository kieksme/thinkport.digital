# We participated in the hackathon #WirvsVirus

NEWS Hackathon

## "Life's most persistent and urgent question is, What are you doing for others?" - Martin Luther King, Jr.

With such thoughts, two members of our team, [Keith Schuijlenburg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAACKRgq8BMkbWrQu2LOU_0nLYZQ3OvV_EBoY/) and [Philipp D' Angelo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAB3aMTcB4eJrtubyPFKoNioU6iZOO5kZPgE/), together with Fabian Bäuerlein, participated in the hackathon of the German government #WirvsVirus and worked tirelessly over the weekend to find creative solutions which combat the crisis caused by the Coronavirus. Their solution? Bringing people together! They created the platform „[wir-unterstuetzen.com”](http://www.wir-unterstuetzen.com/) for all businesses that are economically suffering because of the crisis. Businesses can register on the platform to receive donations from the users and use digital training to enable them to continue offering their products and services. This is the first version of the platform and they will continue to further optimize it and make it easier for everyone to use. What do you think? The whole team thanks you for your commitment.

We are extremely proud of your work!!
