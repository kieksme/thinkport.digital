Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) provides developers and IT teams secure, durable, highly scalable object storage at a very low cost.1 You can store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web through a simple web service interface. You can write, read, and delete objects containing from zero to 5 TB of data. Amazon S3 is highly scalable, allowing concurrent read or write access to data by many separate clients or application threads.

**When to Use**

There are four common usage patterns for Amazon S3.

    •    First, Amazon S3 is used to store and distribute static web content and media. This content can be delivered directly from Amazon S3 because each object in Amazon S3 has a unique HTTP URL.

    •    Second, Amazon S3 is used to host entire static websites. Amazon S3 provides a low-cost, highly available, and highly scalable solution, including storage for static HTML files, images, videos, and client-side scripts in formats such as JavaScript.

    •    Third, Amazon S3 is used as a data store for computation and large-scale analytics, such as financial transaction analysis, clickstream analytics, and media transcoding. Because of the horizontal scalability of Amazon S3, you can access your data from multiple computing nodes concurrently without being constrained by a single connection.

    •    Finally, Amazon S3 is often used as a highly durable, scalable, and secure solution for backup and archiving of critical data.  You can also use Amazon S3 cross-region replication to automatically copy objects across S3 buckets in different AWS Regions asynchronously, providing disaster recovery solutions for business continuity.

**Features**

    •    Low cost and Easy to Use − Using Amazon S3, the user can store a large amount of data at very low charges.

    •    Secure − Amazon S3 supports data transfer over SSL and the data gets encrypted automatically once it is uploaded. The user has complete control over their data by configuring bucket policies using AWS IAM.

    •    Scalable − Using Amazon S3, there need not be any worry about storage concerns. We can store as much data as we have and access it anytime.

    •    Higher performance − Amazon S3 is integrated with Amazon CloudFront, that distributes content to the end users with low latency and provides high data transfer speeds without any minimum usage commitments.

    •    Integrated with AWS services − Amazon S3 integrated with AWS services include Amazon CloudFront, Amazon CLoudWatch, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon RDS, Amazon Route 53, Amazon VPC, AWS Lambda, Amazon EBS, Amazon Dynamo DB, etc.

**Benefits**

Amazon S3 is intentionally built with a minimal feature set that focuses on simplicity and robustness. Following are some of advantages of the Amazon S3 service:

    •    Create Buckets – Create and name a bucket that stores data. Buckets are the fundamental container in Amazon S3 for data storage.  
    •    Store data in Buckets – Store an infinite amount of data in a bucket. Upload as many objects as you like into an Amazon S3 bucket. Each object can contain up to 5 TB of data. Each object is stored and retrieved using a unique developer-assigned key.

    •    Download data – Download your data or enable others to do so. Download your data any time you like or allow others to do the same.

    •    Permissions – Grant or deny access to others who want to upload or download data into your Amazon S3 bucket. Grant upload and download permissions to three types of users. Authentication mechanisms can help keep data secure from unauthorized access.

    •    Standard interfaces – Use standards-based REST and SOAP interfaces designed to work with any Internet-development toolkit.

**Getting Started**

**Pricing**

Amazon S3 charges you only for what you actually use, with no hidden fees and no overage charges. This gives developers a variable-cost service that can grow with their business while enjoying the cost advantages of Amazon's infrastructure.
